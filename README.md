# Untangling-Ocean-Soundscape
Developed a two-stage deep learning system for marine acoustic analysis. Used Conv1D-based unsupervised MixIT for source separation and a Transformer-based multi-modal classifier (MFCC, spectrogram, chroma) with graph attention. Achieved 98%+ accuracy using PIT, attention, and audio augmentation for real-world robustness
